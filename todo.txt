TOP PRIORITY:
-Fully fix Weapon Class: Currently, the margins are very much an issue!
-Add Weapon Level: All official TF2 weapons feature "Level (Level) (Weapon Type, like Scattergun or Wrench)", which is currently missing from the Weapon Generator

NORMAL PRIORITY:
-Add missing "canon" Attributes: If any official Attributes are missing, they should be added!
-Bottom Portion Removal: Remove the section below the actual weapon, mainly the "Generate" button to remove confusion

LOW PRIORITY:
-Custom Attributes: While this is the most fun of the Weapon Generator, it's also the least mandatory right now.
-Example.txt Update: The Example is a bit outdated, but it's likely not going to be viewed anyway.
